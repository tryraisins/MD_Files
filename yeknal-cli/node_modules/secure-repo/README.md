**Drop production-grade security standards into any repository in 30 seconds.**

```bash
npx secure-repo init
```

That's it. Your repo now has battle-tested security policies, checklists, and enforcement rules used in real production SaaS applications.

## Audit Your Repo

Not sure where you stand? Run an instant security audit:

```bash
npx secure-repo audit
```

```
  shipsecure audit

  Scanning repository for security issues...

  Policy files:
    [FAIL] SECURITY.md — missing (high priority)
    [FAIL] AUTH.md — missing (high priority)
    [FAIL] API.md — missing (high priority)
    [warn] DATABASE.md — missing
    [warn] DEPLOYMENT.md — missing

  Environment files:
    [pass] .env is in .gitignore
    [pass] .env.example exists

  Secret scanning:
    [pass] No obvious secrets found in source files

  ────────────────────────────────────
  Results: 3 passed, 2 warnings, 3 issues
  ────────────────────────────────────

  3 issue(s) found. Fix these before shipping.
  Run: npx secure-repo init
```

Zero setup. Zero dependencies. Just run it.

**Don't use the terminal?** Just tell your AI agent:

> Run `npx secure-repo audit` in my project

Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Copilot — any AI coding agent that can run commands.

## The Problem

You're building a SaaS app. You know you should have security policies, but:

- Writing them from scratch takes days
- You don't know what you're missing until something breaks
- AI coding agents generate insecure code when there's no policy file to guide them
- Your team has no shared standard for "how we handle auth" or "what counts as a safe API endpoint"

## The Solution

```bash
npx secure-repo init
```

```
  shipsecure - Adding production standards to your project

  Free templates:
    [done] SECURITY.md
    [done] AUTH.md
    [done] API.md

  Done! 3 files added.
```

Every template is:

- **Opinionated** — makes decisions so you don't have to
- **Actionable** — every rule is verifiable, every pattern is copy-pastable
- **AI-agent friendly** — coding agents read these files and write safer code

---

## What You Get (Free)

Four templates that cover the foundations:

**SECURITY.md** — No secrets in code. Privileged keys server-side only. Database access control mandatory. Server endpoints for all writes. Incident response steps.

**AUTH.md** — JWT verification rules. Token storage (httpOnly cookies, not localStorage). Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2). Rate limiting on login. Session revocation. Role-based access.

**API.md** — Input validation on every endpoint. Rate limiting on all public routes. Error responses that don't leak internals. Endpoint conventions. CORS rules. Pagination enforcement.

**ACCESSIBILITY.md** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Semantic HTML. Keyboard navigation. Screen reader support. Color contrast. Font sizes. Touch targets.

Each file includes:
- Rules marked "MUST FOLLOW"
- Code patterns to copy
- A "Required Checks Before Merge" checklist

## Why This Matters for AI-Assisted Development

If you use Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, or any AI coding agent — these files change how the agent writes code in your repo.

When an AI agent sees `SECURITY.md` in your project root, it follows those rules. When it sees `API.md`, it validates input and handles errors correctly. When it sees `AUTH.md`, it checks tokens server-side.

**Without policy files:** The agent guesses. It writes code that works but may not be secure.

**With policy files:** The agent follows your standards. Every generated endpoint validates input, checks auth, and handles errors safely.

ShipSecure gives your AI agents the rules they need to write production-safe code.
