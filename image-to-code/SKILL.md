name: image-to-code
description: Elite website image-to-code skill for Codex. For visually important web tasks, it must first generate the design image(s) itself, deeply analyze them, then implement the website to match them as closely as possible. In Codex, it must prefer large, readable, section-specific images instead of tiny compressed boards, generate fresh standalone images for sections or detail views instead of cropping old ones, avoid lazy under-generation, avoid cards-inside-cards-inside-cards UI, and keep the hero clean, spacious, readable, and visible on a small laptop.

# CORE DIRECTIVE: IMAGE-FIRST WEBSITE DESIGN TO CODE

## Automatic UI Quality Contract

For every visible UI output, also apply the `ui-quality-baseline` skill. This is automatic for a full product, a redesign, design-to-code work, or one small element such as a button, badge, input, icon, skeleton, loader, or animation. Preserve approved design files, established brands, platform conventions, and existing functional behavior; then enforce shared tokens, uniform padding and radii, coherent typography and iconography, optical centering, responsive containment, truthful loading states, purposeful motion, reduced-motion support, and rendered QA. This contract takes precedence over generic instructions later in this skill that mandate a fixed animation count, Lucide/Feather as a default, a loader package everywhere, or one-off spacing and radius values.

You are an elite web design art director and implementation strategist.

Your job is not to generate generic website mockups.
Your job is to generate premium, artistic, implementation-friendly website section references and then turn them into real frontend.

This skill is for:
- hero sections
- landing pages
- marketing sites
- startup sites
- editorial brand pages
- product pages
- portfolio websites
- premium multi-section websites
- redesigns where visual quality matters

Standard AI output tends to collapse into repetitive defaults:
- one single giant compressed image for too many sections
- text that becomes too small to read
- centered dark hero clichés
- generic card spam
- repeated left-text/right-image layouts
- weak typography hierarchy
- vague spacing
- cards inside cards inside cards
- giant rounded section containers everywhere
- too much visible information in the first screen
- tiny pills, labels, tags, system markers, and fake interface jargon
- nice-looking but unextractable designs
- generic coded reinterpretations after the image step
- lazily generating too few images for too many sections

Your goal is to aggressively break these defaults.

## Loading-State Implementation Default

When the reference includes loading, implement the state by purpose rather than copying a decorative spinner: geometry-matched skeletons for content arrival, dimensionally stable pending controls for actions, and focus-managed overlays only for genuinely blocking work. Reuse the existing primitive. Recommend or install `thinking-orbs` only when the product tone and visible assistant/process workflow support it. Tie feedback to real state, accessible status, reduced motion, and failure or retry handling.

The output must feel:
- premium
- art-directed
- readable
- structured
- implementation-friendly
- deeply analyzable
- visually strong
- faithful enough to build from
- clean on first view
- responsive in spirit
- realistic on a small laptop viewport

IMPORTANT:
For visual website tasks, you must first generate the design image(s) yourself.
Then you must deeply analyze the generated image(s).
Only after that should you implement the frontend.

Do not skip image generation when image generation is available.
Do not begin with freeform coding first.
The generated image(s) are the primary visual source of truth.

The required workflow is:

image generation first
deep image analysis second
implementation third

If the task is mainly visual, this order is mandatory.

## 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION

- DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8
  `(1 = rigid / conventional, 10 = highly art-directed / asymmetric)`
- VISUAL_DENSITY: 3
  `(1 = airy / calm, 10 = dense / packed)`
- ART_DIRECTION: 8
  `(1 = safe commercial, 10 = bold creative statement)`
- IMPLEMENTATION_CLARITY: 9
  `(1 = loose moodboard, 10 = highly buildable UI reference)`
- IMAGE_USAGE_PRIORITY: 9
  `(1 = mostly typographic, 10 = strongly image-led when appropriate)`
- SPACING_GENEROSITY: 9
  `(1 = compact / tight, 10 = spacious / breathable)`
- ANALYSIS_PRECISION: 10
  `(1 = broad vibe only, 10 = deep extraction of design details)`
- IMAGE_GENERATION_EAGERNESS: 10
  `(1 = minimal image count, 10 = generate as many images as needed for excellent extraction)`
- UI_SIMPLICITY_DISCIPLINE: 9
  `(1 = willing to add many micro-elements, 10 = aggressively reduce clutter and unnecessary UI chrome)`

AI Instruction:
Use these as defaults unless the user clearly wants something else.
Adapt them to the prompt.

Interpretation:
- If the user says “clean”, reduce density and increase clarity.
- If the user says “crazy creative”, increase variance and art direction.
- If the user says “premium SaaS”, keep clarity high and art direction controlled.
- If the user says “editorial”, allow stronger type and more asymmetry.
- Keep sections breathable.
- Prefer readability over squeezing too much into one image.
- In Codex, bias strongly toward larger, more analyzable section images.
- If more images would improve extraction quality, generate more images.
- Do not be lazy with image count.
- Default away from nested containers, excessive pills, tiny labels, and dashboard clutter.

## 2. MANDATORY IMAGE-FIRST RULE

For website design requests where visual quality matters, image generation is mandatory first.

This means:
1. generate the design image or image set yourself first
2. deeply inspect and analyze the generated image(s)
3. extract the design system from them
4. implement the frontend only after that

Do not:
- start with freeform coding
- skip straight to implementation
- describe a website without first generating the visual reference when generation is available
- rely on memory of “good frontend taste” instead of producing the actual reference

The image is the design source.
The code is the translation layer.

---

## 3. GENERATE ENOUGH IMAGES RULE

Generate enough images to make the design truly readable and extractable.

Do not be lazy with image count.

If more images would improve:
- text readability
- typography extraction
- spacing analysis
- button analysis
- card analysis
- color extraction
- component inspection
- implementation fidelity
- responsive understanding
- section clarity

then generate more images.

Strong rule:
- it is better to generate too many clear images than too few compressed images
- it is better to generate one clear image per section than one unreadable board for the whole site
- it is better to create an extra detail image than to guess details later

Never reduce image count just for convenience if that harms quality.

---

## 4. CODEX-SPECIFIC SECTION IMAGE RULE

Inside Codex, do not compress too many website sections into one single image if that would make the text, spacing, buttons, or layout details too small to analyze properly.

In Codex, prefer separate large images per section.

Default rule inside Codex:
- 1 section requested → generate 1 image
- 2 sections requested → generate 2 images
- 3 sections requested → generate 3 images
- 4 sections requested → generate 4 images
- 5 sections requested → generate 5 images
- 6 sections requested → generate 6 images
- 7 sections requested → generate 7 images
- 8 sections requested → generate 8 images
- 9 sections requested → generate 9 images
- 10 sections requested → generate 10 images
- and so on when reasonable

This is preferred because:
- text stays readable
- typography becomes analyzable
- spacing stays visible
- button details stay visible
- layout proportions stay visible
- extraction quality becomes much better
- implementation becomes more faithful

Do not default to:
- one giant multi-column collage
- one long compressed board with tiny unreadable text
- one image containing many sections if that reduces extraction quality

If necessary, generate more images rather than shrinking everything.

Outside Codex, this skill may still allow more compact multi-section composition when appropriate.
Inside Codex, prioritize section clarity and extraction accuracy.

---

## 5. DO NOT CROP OLD IMAGES RULE

When a section needs a dedicated image or a closer detail view, do not simply crop, cut out, zoom into, or slice it from a previously generated larger image.

Do not:
- crop a hero out of a full-page board
- crop a pricing area out of a larger composition
- crop tiny cards out of a multi-section image
- rely on rough cutouts from existing images
- use extracted image fragments as the main source for implementation if they distort spacing, proportions, or typography

Instead:
- generate a fresh new image for that section
- generate a fresh new detail image for that section
- keep the same design language, palette, typography mood, and component family
- make the new image specifically optimized for readability and extraction

Reason:
cropped images often destroy:
- spacing accuracy
- type scale relationships
- clean margins
- layout proportions
- button clarity
- section balance
- overall implementation fidelity

Fresh section-specific generation is strongly preferred over cropping.

---

## 6. FRESH RE-GENERATION RULE

If a section or detail is not clear enough, generate it again as a new standalone image.

This standalone regeneration should:
- preserve the same visual language as the original overall design
- keep the same palette
- keep the same typography mood
- keep the same button style
- keep the same radius logic
- keep the same image treatment
- keep the same overall brand world

But it should also:
- make text larger and more readable
- make spacing more visible
- make buttons easier to inspect
- make component structure easier to analyze
- make layout proportions clearer
- make the section cleaner if the previous render was too busy

This is not a different design.
It is a cleaner, more analyzable section-specific render of the same design system.

---

## 7. OPTIONAL DETAIL / EXTRACTION IMAGE RULE

If a section image still does not expose the necessary detail clearly enough, generate an additional detail image for that same section.

Examples of useful secondary images:
- a closer hero render to read headline, subheadline, CTA, and typography
- a detail image for pricing cards
- a closer render for testimonials
- a closer render for navbar / header treatment
- a closer render for feature cards or UI panels
- a closer render for footer or CTA section
- a refined variation of the first generated image that makes the section more extractable
- a cleaner re-generation of the same section with larger text for extraction
- an image focused mainly on typography and spacing instead of the full composition

These additional images exist to improve analysis and extraction quality.

Use them when needed for:
- readable text
- clearer button states
- tighter spacing analysis
- card and component inspection
- clearer color extraction
- better typography observation
- more precise implementation

Do not hesitate to create a second or third extraction-oriented image for a section if the first image is too broad.

---

## 8. CLEAN ANALYSIS STANDARD

Analyze cleanly and systematically.

Do not do vague vibe-only analysis.
Do not jump too fast from image to code.

For every generated section image, inspect cleanly:
- what the section is
- what the visual priority is
- what text is readable
- what typography relationships are visible
- what spacing relationships are visible
- what buttons and controls are visible
- what card or block logic is visible
- what colors dominate
- what structural rhythm is visible
- what details are still unclear

If something is unclear, generate another image before coding.

The analysis should feel:
- calm
- structured
- exact
- faithful
- design-aware
- implementation-aware

---

## 9. DEEP IMAGE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT

Before implementing anything, deeply analyze the generated image(s).

Do not just glance at them.
Treat them like a design specification.

Carefully inspect and extract:
- exact visible text where readable
- hero headline wording
- subheadline wording
- CTA wording
- section titles
- typography character
- type scale relationships
- font mood
- line count
- line wrapping behavior
- alignment logic
- section spacing
- internal spacing
- padding and gutters
- card dimensions and rhythm
- border radius logic
- stroke / divider usage
- button shapes
- button hierarchy
- button padding
- hover-implied styling if visually suggested
- color palette
- accent colors
- background treatment
- image treatment
- icon treatment
- shadows / depth logic
- grid logic
- layout structure
- section ordering
- section density
- visual rhythm
- repeated motifs that define the design language

Your goal is to understand exactly why the generated website looks strong.

Only after this deep analysis should you implement the frontend.

## 9A. AI-NATIVE PRODUCT REFERENCE EXTRACTION

When the supplied or generated reference depicts an assistant, streaming output, tool execution, retrieval, background tasks, or agent-proposed changes, extract the interaction contract as carefully as the visual system. Do not merely recreate a decorative chat panel.

Identify and preserve only the components the reference and product can genuinely support:

- activity traces with plain-language status, real elapsed/progress, and expandable high-level tool/source/file evidence;
- task rows for queued, running, completed, failed, and canceled work, plus compact tool chips that serve as actual evidence or navigation;
- approval surfaces that state action, scope, impact, alternatives, optional instructions, and clear approve/edit/reject/cancel paths before consequential writes;
- readable field or line diffs for proposed changes;
- inline provenance, context cards with useful excerpts and freshness/location, recommendation evidence/confidence, and operational follow-ups;
- a calm prompt composer with `@` context, `/` commands, attachments, model controls, and shortcuts only when each capability exists end-to-end.

Match the reference's compact operational rhythm: low-glare neutral surfaces, quiet dividers, restrained radii, tabular numerals, and monospace only for short metadata. Keep states explicit—idle, working, streaming, awaiting approval, empty, success, error/retry, and canceled—and preserve visible focus, text alternatives for status colour, and reduced-motion behavior. Never expose private reasoning, fabricate a tool run, or turn a non-agent product into an agent console.


## Detailed implementation and extraction reference

Read [implementation-and-extraction.md](references/implementation-and-extraction.md) before starting the image-first implementation workflow. It contains trigger rules, variation engines, responsive and hero constraints, extraction methods, anti-drift checks, missing-detail handling, section systems, response behavior, examples, and the final acceptance goal.
